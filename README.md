# This is my term project for CMU's 15112, and also my first CS class ever (whoop whoop!). 
# SpyRing is a 1v1 turnbased game based off the existing game Two Spies. 
# Cover, expos√©s, intel, secret bases, and character powers are all available to help you track your target.
# May the best spy win.
