# This is my term project for CMU's 15112, and also my first CS class ever (whoop whoop!). 
# SpyRing is a 1v1 turnbased game based off the existing Appstore game Two Spies. 
# Cover, expos√©s, informants, and intel powers galore to help you track down your target.
# Nothing off the table. May the best spy win.
